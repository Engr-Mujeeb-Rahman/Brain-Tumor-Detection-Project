# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning
## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to classify MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories by learning visual patterns from medical images. The project demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and deep learning in the healthcare domain.

This is not a medical product. It is an academic and learning-based project intended to showcase machine learning skills.
