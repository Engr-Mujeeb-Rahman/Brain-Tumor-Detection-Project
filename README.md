# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Project
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained on labeled MRI scans to classify images as tumor or non-tumor. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, aiming to assist in early diagnosis through automated medical image analysis.
